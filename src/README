This is a IIS filter tool to defence request flood attack. I had writen it in 2007, and I 
open source of it to let other person can use this tool freely.

The config file is IisRequestBarrier.ini. The end user can read IisRequestBarrier.ini to find the
detail config information.

The project is support vs2005 x86. 

Later I will make a project for vs2010, support x86, x64 windows.
